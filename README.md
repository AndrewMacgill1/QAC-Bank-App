# QAC-Bank-App
This is a quite basic Bank app created using Java EE technologies, with some functionally for storing Customers credential, Accounts and Transactions in separate tables and all three tables in the database are connected to each other using Entity Relationships.
Not sure why this is on Jawad snakey github, claiming work he barely contributed to
